const leadSinger = (artist = "someone") => {
    console.log(`${artist} is the lead singer of Cold Play`);
}

leadSinger();

if you do not pass an argument

//
const leadSinger = (artist = "someone") => {
    console.log(`${artist} is the lead singer of Cold Play`);
}

leadSinger();


//It is very important to call that function :


function foodshopping( food = "something") {
    console.log(`I'm going to buy ${food} from the grocery shop`);
}

foodShopping();
