- Template Literals are better to use as compared to conventional strings because normal strings can get very ugly.

let word1 = 'Dylan';
let word2 = 'Israel';
let num1 = 2;
let num2 = 3;

const fullName = `${num1 + num2} ${word2}`;

console.log(fullName);

OUTPUT: 5 Dylan Israel.

A Very Clean way to have multi-line strings:

let example = `${word1}
${word2}
`;
